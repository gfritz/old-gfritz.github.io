Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1.

If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too.

                        "markdown": "### Summary\n**Problem:**\n\nIf an entity record is missing required fields, you get an error when trying to deactivate the record from the form.\n\n**Solution Summary:**\n\nI assume you know how to use RibbonWorkbench to edit entity ribbons so I gloss over the setup specifics.  Review the [Getting Started Guide at the author's website](https://ribbonworkbench.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/71374-1-getting-started-with-the-ribbon-workbench) and the [CRM 2016 RibbonWorkbench beta announcement post](http://develop1.net/public/post/Ribbon-Workbench-2016-Beta.aspx) for more information about Ribbon Workbench.\n\n1. Open a solution containing the entities you want to fix in Ribbon Workbench.\n2. Add a Custom Javascript Action **above** the existing Custom Javascript Action.  Our new action must execute first.\n3. Have the action call a function that does the following:\n    1. remove the required level from all form fields then return.  This must be synchronous code \t\t because the next Action will execute immediately after the first action returns.  It should        remember which fields were required if you want to restore them after `statecode` changes.\n    2. *(optional)* add an OnChange event to the `statecode` attribute (make sure this is on the form) to restore the required level to the correct attributes.\n4. Publish the solution from Ribbon Workbench.\n\n---\n\n### The Workaround\n\nIn CRM 2016 ([and similarly for others in 2013+](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/117/t/117841)), we ran into an odd error around deactivating Accounts and Contacts from their forms.  This likely can happen on any record having a Deactivate button.  If a Contact record is missing a required field denoted by a red \\*, then clicking the Deactivate button and completing the popup window by clicking OK, you get a not so helpful error message:\n\n![Popup saying An Error has occurred. Please return to the home page and try again.](http://i.imgur.com/RZGPVLx.png)\n(The obscured window is the \"Confirm Deactivation\" CRM lightbox.)\n\nIf you fill in the required fields and try again (with or without saving the form), then the Deactivate button click works.  Deactivating the record from a homepage grid or subgrid works regardless of the required fields.  The grid approach does not need required fields to be filled.  Why does the form need it?  Since the required fields were the apparent blockers, I thought the button was changing the statecode and statuscode fields, saving the form, and failing because you can't save the form when required fields are empty.  We have to see how the Deactivate button works, and I used [Ribbon Workbench for CRM 2016 (beta)](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/develop1/archive/2016/04/25/ribbon-workbench-2016-beta) to see the function name I need to find.\n\n![Deactivate Account form button in Ribbon Workbench](http://i.imgur.com/GbvTDwn.png)\n\nThe bottom right **Custom Javascript Action** is what an uncustomized Deactivate Button command does when clicked.  Ignore the action above it for now - it is the workaround I will describe later.\n\nThe RibbonWorkbench showed me the library and function the Deactivate button calls - `CommandBarActions.js` and `Mscrm.CommandBarActions.changeState`.  If I am on the Account form, the button calls `Mscrm.CommandBarActions.changeState(\"deactivate\", \"{my-account-guid}\", \"account\")`.  I copied into a gist the code that I followed while trying to mentally trace what happens when Deactivate is clicked in our scenario.  It is not the full CommandBarActions.js file.  I don't find a definitive answer, but if you want to read the optional ramblings, follow the comments from top to bottom in this gist.  It is suffice to know that empty required fields are the root of the problem that we can fix.\n\nI think this is a bug in CRM 2016 forms, but we can work around it in a supported way.  I wonder why the form does not do a [specialized UpdateRequest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn932124.aspx) (fancy name for \"just update the statecode and statuscode in the UpdateRequest\") through REST or WebApi?  It might be on a backlog somewhere.\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/gfritz/99f3a44e2723da5a4980fc739f4c5d8e.js\"></script>\n\nCheck the top right Custom Javascript Action again.  Notice the Custom Javascript Action called `deactivateFromFormWorkaround` taking `PrimaryEntityTypeName` as a parameter.  This will temporarily remove the required level from required fields so deactivating from the form will complete.\n![Custom Javascript Action Workaround with Ribbon Workbench](http://i.imgur.com/GbvTDwn.png)\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/gfritz/fd6a70dfb5258f666b85a217bc289efe.js\"></script>\n\nThis code could have instead done a Metadata query to retrieve which fields are required for this form.  The SDK javascript libraries do asynchronous calls, and you can modify the functions to add a parameter to make them synchronous calls if you want.

This likely can happen on any record having a Deactivate button.  If a Contact record is missing a required field denoted by a red *, then clicking the Deactivate button and completing the popup window by clicking OK, you get a not so helpful error message:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RZGPVLx.png\" alt=\"Popup saying An Error has occurred. Please return to the home page and try again.\" />\n(The obscured window is the \"Confirm Deactivation\" CRM lightbox.)</p>\n\n<p>If you fill in the required fields and try again (with or without saving the form), then the Deactivate button click works.  Deactivating the record from a homepage grid or subgrid works regardless of the required fields.  The grid approach does not need required fields to be filled.  Why does the form need it?  Since the required fields were the apparent blockers, I thought the button was changing the statecode and statuscode fields, saving the form, and failing because you can't save the form when required fields are empty.  We have to see how the Deactivate button works, and I used <a href=\"https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/develop1/archive/2016/04/25/ribbon-workbench-2016-beta\">Ribbon Workbench for CRM 2016 (beta)</a> to see the function name I need to find.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GbvTDwn.png\" alt=\"Deactivate Account form button in Ribbon Workbench\" /></p>\n\n<p>The bottom right <strong>Custom Javascript Action</strong> is what an uncustomized Deactivate Button command does when clicked.  Ignore the action above it for now - it is the workaround I will describe later.</p>\n\n<p>The RibbonWorkbench showed me the library and function the Deactivate button calls - <code>CommandBarActions.js</code> and <code>Mscrm.CommandBarActions.changeState</code>.  If I am on the Account form, the button calls <code>Mscrm.CommandBarActions.changeState(\"deactivate\", \"{my-account-guid}\", \"account\")</code>.  I copied into a gist the code that I followed while trying to mentally trace what happens when Deactivate is clicked in our scenario.  It is not the full CommandBarActions.js file.  I don't find a definitive answer, but if you want to read the optional ramblings, follow the comments from top to bottom in this gist.  It is suffice to know that empty required fields are the root of the problem that we can fix.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is a bug in CRM 2016 forms, but we can work around it in a supported way.  I wonder why the form does not do a <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn932124.aspx\">specialized UpdateRequest</a> (fancy name for \"just update the statecode and statuscode in the UpdateRequest\") through REST or WebApi?  It might be on a backlog somewhere.  </p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/gfritz/99f3a44e2723da5a4980fc739f4c5d8e.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Check the top right Custom Javascript Action again.  Notice the Custom Javascript Action called <code>deactivateFromFormWorkaround</code> taking <code>PrimaryEntityTypeName</code> as a parameter.  This will temporarily remove the required level from required fields so deactivating from the form will complete. <br />\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GbvTDwn.png\" alt=\"Custom Javascript Action Workaround with Ribbon Workbench\" /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/gfritz/fd6a70dfb5258f666b85a217bc289efe.js\"></script>\n\n<p>This code could have instead done a Metadata query to retrieve which fields are required for this form.  The SDK javascript libraries do asynchronous calls, and you can modify the functions to add a parameter to make them synchronous calls if you want.  I think the presented approach is simpler and definitely less code.  You do not have to restore the required levels as it is just a cleanup step.</p>\n\n<p>One problem with this approach is if the user cancels the Deactivate confirmation, then the formerly required fields will still be not required.</p>",

Create a new Contact lookup field, refrential relationship type.\n2. Notice that the default set of field mappings will default the Assistant field to the Contact you are creating the Assistant from.\n3. Register and fire an OnChange event in the Quick Create form OnLoad event to check the Assistant GUID against the CreateFromId from QueryStringParameters.\n4. If the GUIDs match, then you know this form is being used to create an Assistant.\n5. Add JavaScript to the Assistant OnChange that runs when the GUIDs match to do other Assistant-only defaulting that the Relationship Mappings cannot do (or if non-mapped fields should not be changed by the user, then register a Pre-Create of Contact event plugin to set them instead of this JavaScript).\n\nWhen creating a new lookup field, you have to create a new relationship.  CRM will generate a set of default mappings for new relationships.  We wanted to use a lookup to another Contact record instead of using the freetext fields \"Assistant\", \"Assistant Email\", and \"Assistant Phone\" on a Contact.\n\n![Assistant Freetext Fields to replace with a Contact Lookup](http://i.imgur.com/o5f21cn.png)\n\nIn our example, we have created a 1:N relationship from Contact to Contact for a field called Assistant.  Any fields in the mappings list will populate onto the Create form for you.  If you want to use this defaulting in plugin code, you have to use the [InitializeFromRequest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.initializefromrequest.aspx) or [WebApi InitializeFrom function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt683533.aspx).  One of the automatic field mappings defaults the Assistant field of the new record to the Contact from which it is being created.  This is a bad default because it is a circular reference, and CRM complains about it when you try to save the form.  If Assistant was not on the create form, this probably would not happen.  Our requirement specifically wants the field on the form though.\n\n![ContactId to Assistant Mapping You Cannot Change](http://i.imgur.com/cpJpVNj.png)\n\nWe enabled the Contact entity for Quick Create forms, and the Assistant field is on the Quick Create form.  CRM does not let you delete or modify that relationship mapping so we have to do some client-side validation.  Add an OnChange event to the Assistant field and fire it in the OnLoad event of the Quick Create form.  The relationship populates the fields before OnLoad fires.  The OnChange event should clear the Assistant field if the GUID of the Assistant lookup matches the GUID of the source Contact record.  In a Quick Create form launched from a lookup field, you can get the source GUID from `Xrm.Page.context.getQueryStringParameters()._CreateFromId`.\n\nIf I am creating an Assistant for my Contact named \"test, testington\", then this is what the QueryStringParameters return object looks like.  Hit F12 when the Quick Create form is open then type that code - frames[0] or frames[1] might be necessary if the Xrm.Page object is sort of empty.\n![GetQueryStringParameters example](http://i.imgur.com/JabCMpI.png)\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/gfritz/0a1e6d196b93c6207ffcc81f9ce77833.js\"></script>\n\nThe `XrmCommon` stuff is just my wrapper around the `Xrm.Page` object.  In this code block, the function names match Xrm.Page functions, and the only magic they do is check that a field exists on the form before calling the base `Xrm.Page` function.\n\nNow you can do code specific to creating a new Assistant contact.  We know that if the Assistant lookup GUID matches the `_CreateFromId`, then this Quick Create form was launched from the Assistant lookup field on a Contact form.  This Quick Create form is going to create a new Assistant Contact!  In our case, the only additional default we wanted was to set the Relationship Type to a custom OptionSet value labeled \"Assistant\".  Relationship mappings alone cannot do that.  Since we only wanted one field defaulted, I just added one more line into the Assistant OnChange function that I already had.\n\nIf there were many more fields to set, more complicated logic to run, or other records to create or link while creating an Assistant, I would do the work in a plugin registered on the Pre-Operation Create event of Contacts.  If lots of fields were going to get defaulted that the user probably should not change, then good form design would be to not put them on the form at all, and use plugin code to set the defaults during the Pre-Create event.  Do it in the Pre-Create event to create the record with those values already set.  If you do it in the Post-Create event, it will still work, but you cause an Update Contact event which is another transaction and audit history entry.\n\nI think if we did not put the Assistant field on the Quick Create form, we probably would not get the circular reference error in the first place, and we could have used a plugin to default the Relationship Type to Assistant during the Pre-Create stage.",
